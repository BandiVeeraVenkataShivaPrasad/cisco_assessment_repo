JOIN Organization O ON M.ID = O.ID;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.	Write a SQL Query to pull all members that are over 45

WHERE AGE > 45;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.	Write a SQL Query to pull all members that have a dues value of 0.
